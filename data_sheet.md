# Datasheet 

- Dataset: Heart failure <br>
- Source Kaggle URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction/data

## Motivation

- This project aims to predict whether a patient will suffer from heart failure based on various features provided in the dataset. The dataset includes information about patients' demographics, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, and other factors.
- This work demonstrates the use of classification models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM.


## Source & Collection
This dataset was created by combining different datasets already available independently but not combined before. In this dataset, 5 heart datasets are combined over 11 common features which makes it the largest heart disease dataset available so far for research purposes. 

- Each dataset used can be found under the Index of heart disease datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository on the following link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/he


### The five datasets used for its curation are:
1. Cleveland: 303 observations
2. Hungarian: 294 observations
3. Switzerland: 123 observations
4. Long Beach VA: 200 observations
5. Stalog (Heart) Data Set: 270 observations

- 1190 Total observations
- 272 Duplicates removed
- **918 Final dataset**

## Additional Information
